    A few months ago, with very little fanfare, a small new town opened to the public about 25 miles from the centre of London. The place provided an encouraging spurt of economic growth for the area, and it was swiftly populated by a thriving local community unhindered, it seemed, by social and political divisiveness. Unusually for a new town, the buildings lacked any sense of architectural unity: an art deco vacuum-cleaner factory stood near to an 18th-century French-style town hall, while the new train station had a 1930s modernist look. Elsewhere, traditional business was booming, and there was little evidence of the destructive creep of the digital economy. The butcher was doing good trade, as was the greengrocer, and the people walking around the shops didn’t appear to be addicted to their phones. It looked like a model village – not least because it was a model village. Modern happiness such as this comes at a price, and a scale. In this case, the scale is usually 1:12 or 1:18, and the price £11 for adults and £6.60 for children.<br></div>

    The buildings are a new addition to Bekonscot Model Village in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, which next year celebrates its 90th birthday. Many visitors come for the sense of order and control the model village brings to a chaotic life: the schools are decent, the church is full, and the blaze that regularly engulfs a thatched roof in the middle of town is always dealt with swiftly by the fire brigade. In a way that is both wonderful and unnerving, everything appears to be happening at the very moment we arrive. We are just in time for the chimpanzee’s tea party; the cricket match on the green is only now reaching its nail-biting climax. And we are powerless to resist the terrible puns on the shop fronts: Chris P Lettis the greengrocer, Sam and Ella the butcher, Ann Ecdote the bookshop.<br></div>

    Bekonscot is the oldest continuously open miniature village in the world. Almost 16 million people have visited since 1929, and about 15,000 call in each month. In an age of Netflix, Fortnite and artificial intelligence, we may regard it as remarkable that such a thing has not only endured, but thrived and even expanded. How can one possibly explain the appeal? Nostalgia, certainly, but there are numerous bigger, shinier miniature worlds that Bekonscot has inspired – what about them? Is there something else at play? Something utopian perhaps, or something darker for our troubled and unstable times?</div>

    Miniature kingdoms usually have miniature beginnings. No one can say for sure just how Bekonscot came to be, or what its founder intended. The most satisfying story begins with a housebound miniature railway that grew so big, a wife reached for the rolling pin: either it went or she did. The husband, a man named Roland Robert Callingham, a successful accountant, found a third way, and in 1927 laid tracks outside to colonise the garden. The village grew around the railway, but soon became an obsession: after the standard railway buildings came a castle and a church and miniature lawns, followed by the shops, and the population to inhabit them. Callingham did some construction himself, and some with assistance from his gardener and other local modellers. But it was a private pastime, and it only became an attraction after friends suggested that on occasional weekends the public should be allowed in, too. And so Bekonscot opened to all in 1931, and what was a quaint local novelty attracted national press coverage, and then royalty.
